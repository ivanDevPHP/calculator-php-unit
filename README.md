# PHP-Calculator
Simple PHP Calculator to use and do Unit testing, Fuzz testing

Usage:
use your webserver and visit /app/index.php to get the web UI

Unit testing: 
a) run phpunit test installed via shell cmd: 
bash: vendor/bin/phpunit
should return No tests executed! if you are just starting, i.e. no tests are developed

b) when a test is ready, run same bash cmd:
vendor/bin/phpunit

it's probably more interesting to see the output with methods tested and to do this you can issue
the following cmd:
bash: vendor/bin/phpunit --testdox

It works nice if the tests are well descriptive:
ClassName
 - methodName
   - Test case description

So, the test with key --testdox
would output a kind of something like this for a test like "tests/CalculatorTest.php":
PHPUnit 9.6.13 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.
